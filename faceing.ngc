G21 (G21: sets the machine to use metric units for all subsequent commands)
G40 (G40: cancels any previously set cutter radius compensation (CRC) and sets the tool offset to zero.)
G49 (G49: cancels any previously set tool length offset.)
G64 P0.03 (G64 P0.03: sets the motion control to a blended path with a maximum deviation of 0.03 mm from the programmed path.)
G17 (G17: selects the XY plane for cutting. This code specifies that all subsequent X, Y, and Z coordinates are given in a plane parallel to the XY plane.)

G0 X0.0 Y0.0
S18000 (sets the speed to 18000)
M3 (Turns on the spindle clockwise and )
